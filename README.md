Installation
-------------------

1. Download the file [here](https://github.com/hrsetyono/theme_blackboard/archive/1.0.zip)

2. In Sublime, go to `Preferences > Browse Package`.

3. Extract the zip there and rename the folder to `Theme - Blackboard`. Then set it up with the guide below:

**Setting up the Theme**:

1. Change the color scheme by going to: `Preferences > Color Scheme > Theme - Blackboard > Blackboard Dark`

2. Change the interface by going to `Preferences > Setting - User`

It will open a text file. Add the following line to the comma-separated list:

    "theme": "Blackboard Dark.sublime-theme"

Overall, mine looks like this:
    
    {
      "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Blackboard/Blackboard Dark.tmTheme",
      "ignored_packages":
      [
        "Vintage"
      ],
      "theme": "Blackboard Dark.sublime-theme",
    }
